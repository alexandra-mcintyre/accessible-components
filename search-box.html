        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
            The search boxes I observed did well in terms of accessibility because all were pretty clear to 
            navigate as a mouse, keyboard, screen reader, and mobile device user. I especially liked Aritzia’s 
            use of color contrast and instant search features, and I plan on integrating the hover-state color contrast in my design.
            </li>
            <li>
            An accessibility consideration that already existed in the gmail application but was not mentioned 
            in the video was the voice-to-text option on the search bar, which would benefit people who maybe 
            only had a mouse and not a keyboard, or were learning the English language and have trouble spelling. 
            </li>
            <li>
            The change I made to allow for the search box to be activated by any typing of letters solves the mismatch 
            of keyboard users who have trouble navigating the screen quickly using the tab key, or just want to search 
            immediately without having to navigate the whole page.
            </li>
            <li>
            In the case of gmail’s search box, it is especially accessible in the context of its screen reader compatibility
            –when the search bar is focused, the screen reader says “search mail”, and after a search is conducted, it 
            automatically reads “search results web content” and gives the user the option to see the results as the next focus. 
            This differs from the other two pages I analysed, where after the search is conducted, the screen reader resets its
             focus to the main menu, and does not recognize the content shown as results of a search. This functionality for 
             gmail is very beneficial for blind and visually impaired users because it follows the logical order of what a user 
             would expect after searching for mail. However, one aspect where it falls short in terms of accessibility is the lack 
             of a state change when a mouse is hovered over the search bar. The buttons of the page all change color when hovered, 
             and if the search box does not follow this trend it might be difficult for users with poor vision to know where their 
             mouse pointer is. 
            </li>
            <li>
            Between all four users, mouse users are the most commonly prioritized when creating components, but this can lead 
            to accessibility gaps for the other users because developers might overlook proper aria labels for screen readers, 
            or forget to optimize the look of their pages for mobile users.
            </li>
